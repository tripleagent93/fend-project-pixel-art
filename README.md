Youâ€™ll build a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas!

<ul>
<li>Defining variables with const and let</li>
<li>Accessing the DOM using methods of the document object</li>
<li>Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners</li>
<li>Writing nested loops and using loop variables</li>
</ul>
Although not a requirement, you are encouraged to use <strong>jQuery</strong> to manipulate the DOM for this project.
